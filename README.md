#### Spring 2021

This repo represents the code I wrote in conjunction with my 2021 Geographical Sciences BA thesis entitled *Urban Bicycle Infrastructure and Gentrification: A Quantitative Assessment of 46 American Cities*. This research was advised by Professor Marynia Kolak. All mistakes in it, however, are mine alone.

A copy of the thesis can be found in the repo here.
