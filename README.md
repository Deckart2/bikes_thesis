### Overview:
This repo represents the code I wrote in conjunction with my 2021 Geographical Sciences BA thesis entitled *Urban Bicycle Infrastructure and Gentrification: A Quantitative Assessment of 46 American Cities*. This research was advised by Professor Marynia Kolak. All mistakes in it, however, are mine alone.

A copy of the thesis can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/Deckart2/bikes_thesis/blob/master/Thesis_final%20copy.docx). 

If you have any questions, please do not hestitate to reach out to me at gdmorrison [at] uchicago . edu.
